## XLSX Sheets ##

We understand that there are too many apps out there,
that's why we built CRAM to work in the background.


## OPEN_AI ##

Each member of a team is unique and the way they see data is not the same,
that's why we have OpenAI's API summerize and construct each email
to fit the needs of each member's requirements.


## SMTP ##

Our API will collect and process data from all your workflows,
and automatically email the generated reports to the relevant people.


## Crygma Encryption ## 

Crygma Encryption License Allows for Unlimited install (across the board)
Each install implements 4 layers of Quantum Computed encryptions and
allows for for hierarchy/admin control of access to decryption.

<h2>Brief Overview of System Integration</h2>
    <h4>API collections and DataBase update</h4>
    <p>
    The CRAM, will first collect relavent data
    from Fireflies, TimeDoctor and company defined admins, reps, etc.
    The data will then be 'restructured' by the selected A.I., to automate reports and
    sheets, on performance and statistics. 
    For each set of data/information/details, Crygma Encryption system will process the data
    and embed them into the selected transfer method.
    After all data has been processed, emails will be sent via SMTP to the relavent people.
    And the details will updated on the Monday.com CRM, by means of Monday.com's API.
