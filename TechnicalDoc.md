## XCLS Sheets ##

We understand that there are too many apps out there,
that's why we built CRAM to work in the background.


## OPEN_AI ##

Each member of a team is unique and the way they see data is not the same,
that's why we have OpenAI's API summerize and construct each email
to fit the needs of each member's requirements.


## SMTP ##

Our API will collect and process data from all your workflows,
and automatically email the generated reports to the relevant people.
